# Git_Practice

This repository was created to practice Git skills through building a simple Python to-do list application.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `todo_list.py`: A basic command-line to-do list program with built-in test functions.
- `todo_html.py`: An extended version that saves daily tasks into a text file and generates an HTML file for viewing in a browser.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Git branch workflow: development was done in a feature branch and merged into `main`.
- Created and switched branches using the terminal.
- Wrote Python code from scratch (not copied from tutorials).
- Demonstrated real Git usage: add, commit, push, pull, merge.
- HTML export feature using Python for daily to-do tasks.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Run the basic CLI version:
```bash
python todo_list.py
